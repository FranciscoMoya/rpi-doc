# Introductory workshop on Raspberry Pi

This manual is the documentation used in the 3rd edition of our
Introductory Workshop on Raspberry Pi to be held on June 2016 at the
School of Industrial Engineering of the University of Castilla-La
Mancha at Toledo, Spain.

Raspberry Pi is a small personal computer designed as a learning tool
for computer programming and digital electronics.  From a purely
practical point of view we will show you how to configure and use it
to develop your own programs. Considerable effort will be spent on how
to interface the physical world, adding sensors and actuators of
different kinds.
